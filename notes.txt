*** Preventing duplicate Items
Use the onSuccess callback metadata
The onSuccess callback is called when a user successfully links an Item using Plaid Link. This callback provides metadata that you can use to prevent duplicate Items from being created. One approach is to require a user login prior to launching Plaid Link so that you can retrieve existing Items associated with the user.

Then, before requesting an access_token, examine and compare the onSuccess callback metadata to the user's existing Items. You can compare a combination of the accountsâ€™ institution_id, account name, and account mask to determine whether an end user has previously linked an account to your application. Do not exchange a public token for an access token if you detect a duplicate Item.

While the mask value is usually the same as the last 4 digits of the account number, this is not the case at all institutions. Never detect duplicate Items by attempting to match a mask with an account number.
